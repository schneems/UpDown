# UpDown

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/779ff8b74f3d4fd1ab528186981d6340)](https://www.codacy.com/app/Micathon3/UpDown?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=StellarDoor5319/UpDown&utm_campaign=badger)

## Overview

UpDown is an editor for the language Markdown, allowing you to have syntax highlighting and preview your changes at the same time.

## Cloning

As UpDown contains a submodule (or "subrepository"), it will need to be cloned with a different option, `--recursive`. This option tells Git to recurse into the submodule and clone that too. Therefore, you will use the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/StellarDoor5319/UpDown --recursive
```
